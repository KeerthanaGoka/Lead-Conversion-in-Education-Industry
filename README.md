# LeadScore Case Study
Problem statement
X Education sells online courses to industry professionals.
Although X Education gets a lot of leads, its lead conversion rate is very poor.
The company wishes to identify the most potential leads also known as “Hot Leads”.
If they successfully identify this set of leads, the lead conversion rate should go up as the sales team will now be focusing more on communicating with the potential leads rather than making calls to everyone.

Business Objective:
Identify the leads that are most likely to convert into paying customers.
Build a model wherein you need to assign a lead score to each of the leads such that the customers with higher lead score have a higher conversion chance and the customers with lower lead score have a lower conversion chance.
